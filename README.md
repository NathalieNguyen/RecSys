# A Recommender System for Book Crossing

The goal of this project is to build a recommender system for book crossing by predicting the user’s preferences. The recommender system explores the relationships between users and items with the result of creating a top-N recommendation list for a specific user. 


## Dataset

In the following the main data sources for this project are listed. The book genres used for content-based models are not available in the original dataset and were crawled from the corresponding book crossing website.
